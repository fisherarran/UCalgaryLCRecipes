# **YES, FINALLY THE BEST MUFFINS!**
Blueberry Mango Muffins w/ Coconut Streusel Topping

1. Preheat an *oven* to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease 16 muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners.
2. Combine 1/4 cup flour, the cinnamon, 1 tablespoon sugar, the coconut, and 1 pinch of salt in a small bowl. Mix in 2 tablespoons of butter until completely incorporated into the flour; set aside.
3. Beat the unsalted butter, 1 1/4 cups sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat the first egg into the butter until *completely* blended before adding the second; continue mixing until light and fluffy. Combine 1 3/4 cups of flour with the baking powder. Stir into the butter mixture alternately with the buttermilk. Toss the blueberries with 1/4 cup of flour; stir into the batter along with the mango. Scoop the batter into the prepared muffin tins; sprinkle with the coconut streusel.
4. Bake in the preheated oven until golden and the tops spring back when lightly pressed, 25 to 35 minutes.
5. You should eat these muffins, ~~alone~~, at 3am
